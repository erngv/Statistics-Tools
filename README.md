# Statistics Tools

### This simple C++ project was inspired by HackerRank's Ten Days of Statistics, which introduces different concepts related to Statistics and Probability, and its purpose is to aid on the computation of different probability distributions and other Statistics calculations

The tools calculator asks the user to choose the computation to perform from the menu below, and specifies which kinds of inputs (i.e., number of elements, number of trials, probability of sucess/failure, etc.) it expects.

* Mean
* Weighted Mean
* Mode
* Median
* Standard Deviation
* Factorial
* Quartiles
* Binomial Probability Distribution
* Poisson Probability Distribution
* Geometric Probability Distribution
* Normal Probability Distribution
* Pearson Correlation Coefficient
* Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient

#### As this is an on-going project, this repository will be updated to include input/output examples for each computation in the menu.
